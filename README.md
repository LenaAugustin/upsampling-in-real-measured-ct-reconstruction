# Overview over python files

Code that needs to be changed (e.g. the path to the sinograms) is marked "TODO"

- dataset.py: Dataloader for the network
- helper.py: helper functions like loading sinograms and saving them
- inference.py: pass the test set through an .onnx file of the network
- interpolate.py: subsample and interpolate sinograms. Used for evaluation of the network
- SinNet_CNN.py: Convolutional network. Called by train.py
- SinNet_U-Net.py: U-Net. Called by train.py
- SSIM.py: calculate mean SSIM and PSNR of a set of reconstructed images
- train.py: run this code to train the network
